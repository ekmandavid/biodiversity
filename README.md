# Biodiversity
This is a project from Codecademy, https://www.codecademy.com/paths/data-science-foundations/tracks/dscp-data-analysis-portfolio-project/modules/dscp-biodiversity-in-national-parks/kanban_projects/biodiversity-in-national-parks-portfolio-project , where we explore (fictional) data from four different national parks in the USA. 

The data files are
- `species_info.csv` contains the different species: their category, scientific name, common name, and if it is protected or not.
- `observations.csv`contains the observations made in four different national parks of the scientific names of the species.

We use Jupyter Notebook and Python Pandas Dataframes for the tasks.

The key metrics are:
- Distributions
- Counts
- Relationships between species
- Conservation status of species
- Observations of species in the national parks.
